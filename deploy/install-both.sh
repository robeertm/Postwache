  Both are starting, and they already know each other.

    DocuSort     http://$HOST:8080     documents and household finances
    Postwache    http://$HOST:8110     watches your mailbox

  First visit to DocuSort asks you to create the admin account. Then tell the
  Postwache about your mailbox — and attachments start arriving on their own.

  Updates happen by themselves, nightly at 04:00.
