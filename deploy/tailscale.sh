# Tailscale overlay there too (so a plain `docker compose up -d` keeps using
# it), starts everything and prints the address.

# Afterwards postwache is reachable at
#
#     https://postwache.<your-tailnet>.ts.net
#
# with a certificate Tailscale fetches and renews by itself. Nothing is exposed
# to the internet, no port forwarding, no reverse proxy, no certificate to look
# after. Everyone on your tailnet gets in; nobody else can, because there is
# nothing out there to reach.
#
# Run it again any time — it is idempotent, and it is also how you rotate the

If the browser complains that the certificate does not exist, one switch is
still off — this is the only thing that cannot be done from here:

  Tailscale admin console → Settings → DNS
    • MagicDNS               on
    • HTTPS Certificates     on

Then run this script again (or just `docker compose restart tailscale`).

Look at what it says:

    $COMPOSE logs tailscale | tail -20

The usual causes: the auth key is used up (generate a REUSABLE one), or it
belongs to a different tailnet.
